          What began as a simple love for coffee turned into a passion for
          creating meaningful experiences. We believe coffee is more than a
          drink — it’s a moment to pause, connect, and recharge.
        </p>

        <p>
          From sourcing quality beans to crafting intuitive digital experiences,
          our journey is about care, creativity, and community.
        </p>

        <p>
          This platform was built with users in mind — people who value
          simplicity, authenticity, and great design as much as great coffee.
